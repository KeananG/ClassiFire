# Project Overview
  The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that can predict the fire management complexity level of a wildfire. Fire management complexity represents the highest management level utilized to manage a wildland fire. This target provides valuable insights into the resources needed and the potential scale, size and impact of a fire.

  This classification model analyzes various features associated with the a wildfire incident, including meteorological data, bureaucratic data, and locational data. The developed classification model will enable fire management agencies to anticipate the resources required should a wildfire occur based on the location and current meteorological data. This model doesn't replace the realtime complex decision of determining fire management complexity level (like evaluating the risk to the firefighters). However this model can aid in helping predict if a new wildfire incident will be a large scale/impacting event based on the predicted fire management complexity.

# Business Understanding

<!--In this section, explore the business understanding of the project, focusing on the value it provides and the real-world problem it addresses. The business understanding assesses how well the project explains the significance of the problem and its stakeholders.-->

Wildfires pose significant risks to life, property, and the environment. Effective fire management is crucial for mitigating these risks and minimizing the impact of wildfires. Predicted fire management complexity level evaluates if a location is at risk of being resource intensive or potentially large threat to life and property should a wildfire occur. This can help identify regions that need to be on high alert and preparedness to minimize the impact of a wildfire.

The fire agencies administrator is responsible for setting the fire managment complexity level. Their decision follows a set of standarized and subjective guidelines. Some of these guidelines are utilized as features in this project. 

Fire management agencies, administrators, and other personnel responsible for allocating resources and planning fire response strategies would benefit from being able to accurately and efficiently predict the fire management complexity level of wildland fire incidents. This allows for them to anticipate the required resources, as well as assess the potential scale and impact of a fire. This information is crucial for fire management agencies to make informed decisions and ensured preparedness for faster fire response times.

<!-- It is important to note that the assessment of the business understanding focuses on how well the project explains its value and addresses a real-world problem, rather than evaluating the intrinsic value itself. By effectively conveying the significance of the problem and its stakeholders, the project demonstrates its relevance and practicality -->

# Conclusion

### The final model scores: 
|Complexity level  | precision | recall | f1-score | support |
|----------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Type 1 Incident |   0.75    |  0.60  |   0.67   |    10   |
| Type 2 Incident |   0.11    |  0.08  |   0.10   |    12   |
| Type 3 Incident |   0.39    |  0.25  |   0.30   |   124   |
| Type 4 Incident |   0.65    |  0.81  |   0.72   |   467   |
| Type 5 Incident |   0.96    |  0.91  |   0.94   |   1320  |
| accuracy       |           |        |   0.84   |   1933  |
| macro avg      |   0.57    |  0.53  |   0.54   |   1933  |
| weighted avg   |   0.84    |  0.84  |   0.84   |   1933  |


The final model performs best at predicting type 5 incidents, even though I used smote, the majority of wildfires occur at the type 5 incident. This means that most fires are put out within a few days and or only require a few firefighters.
Type 4 incident is one level up and type 1 incidents have the next best performance. With type 2 and 3 performing poorly. Looking at the usability of this model it is more significant to be able to predict both extremes well. 
If a fire incident is 1 day old it is likely still at type 5, this model will be able to use current and forecasted meteorological data, and bureaucratic features such as agency and dispatch center to predict the fire incidents fire complexity level. Further evaluation shows that the highest mean acres burned and economic cost correlate with type 1 incidents, This for one confirms that fire complexity levels do correlate with fire scale and impact. However, this is not absolute, when evaluating the max acres burned for each level types 1, 3, and 5 all share close max acres burned. This could be an error in the data or Possibly more underlying factors influencing the fire complexity level. One speculation is that large fires occurring in heavily remote regions are less of a risk to people and communities. Further analysis also shows that type 4 incidents have the largest cumulative acres burned and economic costs. This is likely due to just the class imbalance as the mean shows that type 1 incidents are significantly higher in both features.

# Next Steps

Looking at the next steps, I am looking to further improve model performance by adding additional features such as calculating drought data, remoteness index, and improving RAWS site selection. After this, I am looking to build a streamlit deployment of the model. This will involve setting up APIs and pulling current RAWS data, and potentially forecasted Meteorological data.
